Identifying Drug Comsumers using sentimental Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is an important algorithm in Natural Language Processing which is used to detect sentiment within some text.

 In our project, we had chosen to work on analyzing reviews of various drugs which have been reviewed in form of texts and have also been given a rating on a scale from 1-10

Â Our intention was mainly to implement supervised machine learning classification algorithms that predict the class of the rating using the textual review.
